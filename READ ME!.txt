Sedusa Mode Handy Controller

Welcome to Sedusa Mode! This is a simple guide to help you set up and enjoy your new immersive experience for The Handy.
WINDOWS ONLY.

## What Does It Do?

* Immersive Narrative: Engage with Medusa, who controls your Handy's movements in real-time with an evolving story.
* Fully Customizable Experience: Adjust the depth and intensity to create your perfect session.
* It Remembers You: Your preferences are saved, so you don't have to set them every time.
* Internet-Connected for Control: The app requires an internet connection to send commands to The Handy's servers.
* Built-in Safety: The app includes safety limiters to ensure movements always stay within your comfortable range.

## How to Get Started (easier than it looks!)

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

You need one free program to run the app.

**Python:**
* Download the latest stable version of Python 3 (e.g., Python 3.12 or newer) from the official Python website:
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
* During installation, you **must check the box** that says "Add Python to PATH" or "Add Python to environment variables." This is crucial!

### Step 2: Get Sedusa Mode Ready

* **Download the Project:**
    * Go to the project's GitHub page).
    * Look for a green button that says `<> Code` or "Download Code."
    * Click on that button, and then select **"Download ZIP."** This will download all the project files in a single compressed file.

* **Unzip the Files:**
    * Find the downloaded ZIP file (it's probably in your "Downloads" folder).
    * **Right-click** on the ZIP file.
    * Select **"Extract All..."** (or similar option like "Unzip" or "Extract here").
    * Choose a simple location to extract it to, like your Desktop or Documents folder. This will create a new folder (e.g., "Sedusa Mode" or "Medusa Mode-main").
    * Open this newly extracted folder. Make sure all original subfolders (like `content`, `data`, `web`, `device`, `haptics`) are present inside it. This is your main "Sedusa Mode" project folder.

* **Install Required Libraries:**
    * **Open a Command Prompt directly in your Sedusa Mode project folder:**
        * Open the extracted "Sedusa Mode" folder.
        * Click on the **address bar** at the very top of the File Explorer window (where it shows the folder's path).
        * Type `cmd` (lowercase is fine) and press `Enter`. A black Command Prompt window should appear, already in the correct folder.
    * In this black Command Prompt window, type this command and press Enter:
        
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
    * This will install Flask and Requests. Wait for it to finish. You'll see text scrolling.

### Step 3: Run the App!

* Start the Server:
    * In the **same terminal** (Command Prompt window, still in your project folder), run this command:
        
        python app.py
        
    * The server is working when you see a message similar to: `Running on http://127.0.0.1:7860`.
    * **Keep this terminal window open.** If you close it, the app will stop.
    * **IMPORTANT:** The first time you run this, your computer's firewall might ask for permission. You **MUST allow** network access for the app to work.

* Open in Browser:
    * Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) and go to the following address:
        `http://127.0.0.1:7860`
    * The Sedusa Mode application will appear. You will be guided through entering your Handy API key (one time) and selecting your intensity.

### To Stop the App:

* Go back to the black terminal window where `app.py` is running.
* Press `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard.
* If it asks to terminate, type `Y` and press Enter.
* The window will then close.
